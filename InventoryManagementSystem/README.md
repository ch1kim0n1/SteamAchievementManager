# Inventory Management System (Local Only)

This is a simple WinForms app to manage a local, mock player inventory and currencies. It does not connect to Steam or any game. Use it as a sandbox for prototyping UI/logic without touching real services.

Features:

- Add/remove currencies with code, name, amount
- Import/export inventory state to JSON

Limitations:
- No network or platform integration
- Not intended to modify live games or services
